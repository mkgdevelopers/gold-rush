# 🪙 Gold Rush - CLI Game

A simple and fun command-line game built using C++. The objective is to dig for gold by guessing the correct coordinates on a 10x10 grid. You only have 10 moves, so make every guess count!

---

## 🎮 How to Play

- You’ll see a 10x10 grid filled with dots (`.`).
- Enter the **column and row numbers** (e.g., `3 4`) to dig a spot.
- If you find gold, a `+` appears and your score increases!
- If not, you’ll see a `-`.
- The game ends after 10 moves.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

- C++ arrays to store hidden gold positions and player guesses.
- Random gold placement using `rand()` and `time(NULL)`.
- Score calculation and feedback system.
- Basic cross-platform screen clearing using `system("clear")` or `system("cls")`.
